    <!--what is github-->
    <!--GitHub is a web-based platform that serves as a version control system and a collaboration platform for software development. It provides a set of tools and features that enable developers to work on projects, collaborate with others, and manage code repositories. Here's an explanation of key concepts related to -->

    <!--Version Control System (VCS): GitHub is built on top of a version control system called Git. Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes in their code over time. It helps them manage different versions of their project, collaborate with others, and easily revert to previous states if needed.-->

    <!--Code Repository: In the context of GitHub, a code repository (or "repo") is a central location where all the project files, source code, and related assets are stored. Repositories can be public (visible to everyone) or private (restricted to selected collaborators).-->

    <!--Branch: A branch is a separate line of development in a Git repository. It allows multiple developers to work on different features or fixes simultaneously without interfering with each other. Branches can be created, merged, and deleted as needed.-->
